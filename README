PlanningWeb is another application for the Spirit project from the Faculty of
Computer Science of the University of Applied Sciences Schmalkalden.

http://pads.fh-schmalkalden.de/spirit.html

It will act as the frontend for planning the curriculum.

It is/will be developed with Scala 2.8.1 and Lift 2.3.

http://www.scala-lang.org
http://www.liftweb.net

Features:
* Usage of CSS Selectors in Lift.

* Working against MongoDB and other Databases (only MongoDB is implemented yet), switchable via TAG in the prop files.

Hints:
* The fhsldap_2.8.1-1.0.jar which is located in the lib/ folder
  is the module found at https://github.com/mdenison/FhS-LDAP-Module.
  Of course it is possible to use the module as described in its README.

* Working SBT 0.7.4 installation is needed http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/.

* Not fully functional yet....


Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
run:
$ sbt update compile

If this works without any errors go on with editing the Prop file as needed.

Using PlanningWeb with MongoDB simply set
spirit.pers.layer=mongoDB
in the default.props file.

Running
$ sbt test
should pass all tests with MongoDB as Databases.

After everything is set up, run:
$ sbt ~jetty-run
should give a Welcome screen at http://localhost:8081

Log In with the User "admin".

Now you can add dozents, courses, lectures and so on ...
